# Project Charter

**Project Title**: Potato Chat

**Start Date**: 11/10/2019&emsp;**End Date**: 13/12/2019 

**Project Manager**: Gjergjaj Albert

**Project Sponsor**: 

**Customer**: Sette Antonio 

**Users**: Students of class 5ei
___
**Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressd by the project)**:
The first purpose of this project is to provide the 5Ei students a way to communicate in a fast way and also learn how to create a complex project like this and to maintain it in the future. We envision having a general chat based on a topic, so that users can easily talk with people who share the same interests.

A second aim of the project is to give the possibility to the users to talk privately with each other. This gives the app more flexebility, so users that don't want to participate in a public room or don't want to bother other users, can talk privately.
____
**Goals and Objectives**: 

The overall goal of the project is to create a software that gives users an alternative way to chat with each other. The chat should:

* Be useful. It should help students to communicate with each other easily.
* Be easy to use. The graphical user interface of the chat should be user friendly, so people that don't have any prior computer experience will know how to use it without any problem or suggestions of the programmers that developed the app.
* Be lightweight. It shouldn't take too much resources to run it.
* Have two types of chat:

    1. The first type is the public chat. This public chat is opened when the user enters the credentials (alias and topic). This allows the user to talk with people that share the same interest, based on on a topic.
    2. The second type is the private chat that allows users, that don't want to talk in a public room, to communicate with different users that are online(visible on the public room) privately.
___

___
**Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)** :

The project didn't have any budget.
___
**Project Priorities and degrees of freedom :**

Dates are not flexible, because the release date is fixed and it cannot change,with the only exception when the team runs into multiple problems and has to finish some additional features. Roles can change based on problem that single components of the group run into.
___
**Approach:**

It is planned to use the scrum methodology. The work will be separated in multiple dates and every member of the team has it's own feature that he has to complete, such as the creation of the packets or the GUI creation and managment. Using this methodology the members can work on the on their feature and at the last sprint everything will be assembled. In each sprint there will be a meeting where every team member will report what he has done.

The team members have a discreet experience with the methodology and programming language and this will help us reduce the time of the development. 
___
**Constratins** :

The final solution should rely only on free third-party libraries, that help us to speed up the production.
___
**Assumptions** : 

We assume that the meeting with the customer and a few users will be available every time we request it. We also assume that during these meetings the customer will be available to answer questions on the product. Feedback is needed on all the features implemented at every sprint.

The project team will create the packets and the graphical user interface for the application during the iterations. The app isn't secured, so it's up to the users to use the app correctly.
___
**Success Criteria** : 

The success of the product will be defined on the campus website where the customer will give a grade to the project. If the grades are superior than a certain threshold, it will mean that the project was a success.

Also if the goals are achieved the project will be considered successful.
___
**Scope** : 

If the time isn't enough only the essential features will be implemented, such as the public chat. If the time results in being enough, the scope will be extended to include all the goals set for this project, such as the private chat.
___
**Risks and obstacles to success** :

The team has a discreet level of experience in programming with java, but the only risk we can run into is time. If the time isn't enough we won't be able to achieve all the goals of the project.

The solution for this problem is to divide the tasks among the group members,
so it becomes easier to handle the work load.

Another risk we can run into is that the app start to become too heavy.

The solution to this problem, to make the app faster and lighter, is to add multiple threads that handle incoming packets.
