
# Success Criteria for Potato Chat Client Project

### The Potato Chat Client project will be considered a success if   .   .    .

**A fully functional test system is delivered on or before December 6th.**

The system shall be deployed in a state that is ready to be used for its intended purpose. The users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the system. We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:
- No one circles “No” on the first two questions
- If anyone circles “Yes, with reservations” on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to April 20th to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations.


**Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan**

All critical defects found before end of the last assignment will be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale. Changes taking 6 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 4 hours or less will be done if notified of the change half a  week before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 1 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 days before the scheduled end of the project.

Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.

**5Ei class can easily log into the system**
This means that the 5Ei students will be able to login by typing the alias and the topic of the chat and pressing the login button.

**Potato Chat Client user can create and edit their account**
This means that only the user that is using the client will be able to change the alias of the account.

**Potato Chat Client supervisors can print all reports outlined in spreadsheet sample reports provided during the requirements meeting**
These reports shall be in the form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheets or Google spreadsheet with the data properly displayed. The data on the report should accurately reflect that which is in the server log in the last month of use.

**The System is mostly documented** 
First, a User Guide shall be produced. The guide shall be easy to use and comprehensive. This manual shall explain only how to use the main features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system.

**Known defects are stored in a document by Developers**
Defects that are found but not fixed immediately (less than 1 hour) will be submited to Github with priorities so they can be resolved as fast as possible. At the end of the project there shall be no unresolved defects.
