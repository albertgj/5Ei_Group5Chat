## 1 Overview
### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
Team 5 is interested in creating a desktop chat application that will be useful to the
students of 5Ei class, so they can communicate without using the mobile phone. The
Potato Chat will accomplish this by giving the possibility to chat in a public room or in a
private chat.
The Potato Chat app will give the possibility to the users to login in with an alias directly
on the application. After the login there will be two main features:
1) The first one is the public chat where users can access it by using a topic. This
allows the user to talk with others that share the same interest.
2) The second one being the private chats, where users that don’t want to talk
in a public room can talk with someone privately. This can be done after the
user registers and logs in the public room, which provides a list of online
users.
The application will work on all desktop machines that have different Os, thanks to Java.

The user interface will be user friendly, so it can be used without consulting a user
manual. Every complex task will be hidden by us.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives
The overall goal of the project is to create a software that gives users an alternative and fast way to chat with each other.
Project Goals:
1. Create an application that sends messages to a public chat.
2. Create a screen where you can send messages to a private chat.
3. Create a login screen.

Project Objectives:
1. Create a simple but effective user interface
2. Implement all the features required by the teacher

___

## 1.4 Assumptions and Constraints

### 1.4.1 Assumptions
1. Server will allow our client to send messages.
2. The customer and a few user will be available every time we request it
3. Feedback is needed on all the features implemented
4. During meetings the customer will be available to answer questions on the
product.
 
### 1.4.2 Constraints
Constraints:
1. The application to run on every desktop OS needs java installed.
2. The application should rely only on open source libraries, that help us to speed up the production.

___
## 1.5 Schedule and Budget Summary

### 1.5.1 Cost Estimate
The project didn’t have any budget.
If we achive all the goals and the grade is superior than a certain threshold, then it will mean that the project was successful.
___
## 1.6 Definitions

| Actor | user or other software system that receives value from a user case. |
| Baselined | the work product has undergone a formal review and can only be changed through the prescribed change control procedures |
| Client or Customer | the person or organization for which this Potato Chat application is being built. |
| Developer | the person or organization developing the system, also sometimes called the supplier. |
| Project | activities that will lead to the production of the Potato Chat application. |
| Potato Chat Application | the product that is being described here; the software system specified in this document. |
| Scenario | one path through a user case |
| Stakeholder | anyone with an interest in the project and its outcomes. This includes clients, customers, users, developers, testers, managers and executives. |
| User | the person or persons who will actually interact with the Potato Chat application. |
| Use case  | describes a goal-oriented interaction between the system and an actor. A use case may define several variants called scenarios that result in different paths |
___
## 2 Startup Plan
### 2.1 Team Organization
| Role | Actor(s) | Responsibility |
| -------- | ----------- |---------|
| Project Manager | Gjergjaj Albert | Call team meetings, coordinate communications within group,coordinate communications outside group, break out tasks, assign them to teammates|
| Developer | All group members | Develop software based on requirement and architect specifications|
| Programmer | All group members |Program to requirement and architect specifications |
| Tester | All group members | Write test cases, perform unit testing of test cases against incremental release of code, perform integrated testing of test cases against incremental release of code, report issues|

### 2.2 Project Communications

| Project Status Report | Review finished items, status of prototype; review any problems, schedule slippage, programming issues | All team members, teacher | E-mail with information or Inperson as customer sees fit |Iteration Closeout |

### 2.3 Technical Process
For this project we used the Scrum methodology and feedback will be used at the end of each sprint.

### 2.4 Tools
- Programming language - Java
- Operating System – Desktop Os's
- Version Control – Git and Github
- Development Tools – Netbeans

___
## 3 Work Plan
### 3.1 Resource Estimate
The application is lightweight and it doesn't require a lot of resources to run. It is estimated that you need a minimum of 250 Mb RAM and 500 Mb HDD.

### 3.2 Release Plan
#### 3.2.1 Plan By Feature
    Sprint #1 11/08 – 11/15

**Summary:** We create the packets needed for the backend.

| -------- | ----------- |-----|
| Architecture / Packet construction | 50 | 60 |

    Sprint #2 11/22 – 11/29

**Summary:** We develop the Gui and bind the packets with it.

### 3.3 Sprint Plans
A detailed sprint plan will be provided for sprint 1. Further task details are available in the schedule.

#### 3.3.1 First Sprint
We have created a protocol witch will be used by the software to communicate with the servers.

#### 3.3.2 Second Sprint
We have implemented the Gui and the features of the actual software.

#### 3.3.3 Final Product
The final product is a software with let's you communicate with other people trough a server. The product has different features like private chat and custom topic rooms.

## 4 Control Plan
## 4.1 Configuration Management Plan
The following procedure is to be used when making changes to all baselined work
products:

1. All project work products will be stored in a centralized repository running on
Github.
2. All baselined documents will have a Document Control section with a change
history to track initialization and subsequent changes.
3. All project work products (documents, source code, test cases, program data,
test data, etc) will be stored in the Github repository but not all will be under
change control (subject to formal change control procedures.) Only the system
requirements, project plan and source code will be baselined and under
configuration control.
4. Items that are subject to change control will be considered baselined after a
group review at the end of the initial document creation.
5. The change control procedure once a product is baselined is:
   1. anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item sends an email to the rest of the team and project sponsor (i.e. Professor Sette) describing the change, reason for the change, expected schedule impact, and time line for integrating the change.
   2. if no one responds to the group within 2 days with a reason for why the change request shouldn't be permitted, it will be considered accepted and the person proposing the change may proceed with the change.
   3. if anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will be discussed at a meeting where everyone is invited to attend and voice their opinion. At the end of the meeting a democratic vote will be held to decide whether or not the change should be allowed.

## 5 Supporting Process Plans
### 5.1 Risk Management Plan
| Rank | Risk | Probability of Loss | Size of Loss | Risk Exposure | Response |
| -------- | ----------- |-----|----|-----|-----|
| 1 | Schedule/timeline delivery | Likely | Major | High | Mitigate: Stick to the schedule |
| 2 | Protocol and gui Developing | Likely | Moderate | Moderate | Avoid: Spending too much time on thinking about the protocol structure |
| 3 | Feature 1: Private chat | Unlikely | Moderate | Moderate | Avoid bugs |
| 4 | Feature 2: See list of connected people | Unlikely | Minor | Low | Avoid: Not using protocol standards and using local methods.|

### 5.2 Product Acceptance Plan
At the conclusion of each sprint, the prototype created will be tested to ensure if it meets the requirements of that sprint.

For the final sprint, product acceptance testing will ensure that the prototype functions as expected with a user's data.
